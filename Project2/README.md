This project is to implement a voting system using Plurality and STV with waterfall software development method.
We are using Agile Scrum methodology to finish all the committed PBIs within the 4-week sprint.
The program is implemented in java and can be run both using terminal and Eclipse.

Run using terminal:
Case One: No command line arguments
	1. Use the command "make" to use the provided makefile to compile the program
	2. Run using the command "java Main"
	3. System will prompt for an input file name.

Case Two: Run with one argument
	1. Use the command "make" to use the provided makefile to compile the program
	2. Run using the command "java Main <input_File_name>"
	3. The first argument indicates the input file name. No system prompts.

Case Three: Run with two arguments
	1. Use the command "make" to use the provided makefile to compile the program
	2. Run using the command "java Main <input_File_name> off"
	3. The first argument indicates the input file name. The second argument is indicates developers to conduct testing by turning off the shuffle option

Run using Eclipse:
Case One: No command line arguments
	1. Put all .java files under a package
	2. Run Main
	3. System will prompt for an input file name.

Case Two: Run with one argument
	1. Put all .java files under a package
	2. Run Configurations -> Arguments -> <input_File_name> -> Run
	3. The argument indicates the input file name. No system prompts.

Case Three: Run with two arguments
	1. Put all .java files under a package
	2. Run Configurations -> Arguments -> <input_File_name> "off" -> Run
	3. The first argument indicates the input file name. The second argument is indicates developers to conduct testing by turning off the shuffle option
